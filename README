Open source is becoming a dominant development model in the software
industry. The next generation of software developers, computer
scientists, system administrators, analysts, and build engineers need
to understand Open Source and must be able to work efficiently within
Open source communities.

TeachingOpenSource.org is a neutral collaboration point for
professors, institutions, communities, and companies to come together
and make the teaching of Open source a global success.
